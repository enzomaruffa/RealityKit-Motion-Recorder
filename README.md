# Motion Recorder

An app made for pose recording using RealityKit. It saves the user's joints position using a moving window as a document in JSON format.

## How to find your JSON files

1. Using XCode, go the the top menu Window > Devices and Simulators.
2. Find your device in the list
3. Select the Motion Recorder app and click in the cog below the list
4. Select "Download container..."
5. Open your container and go to the "Documents" folder inside it

## Important info

This app is being used to record movements in another project. I cannot guarantee that it will work for your needs or it is even something more than a tool. So, feel free to use it in whatever way you need. 

It also uses a very unoptimized tree to store the joints. If you'd like to refactor it and improve it's performance, go on :)
